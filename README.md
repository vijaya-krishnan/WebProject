# WebProject
Created new repository for the webproject using playwright

# Project Name : Web Automation: Flight Booking

# Project Scope:
Frame work : Hybrid + POM pattern + utilties+ Listeners + TestNG + Extent Reports

#project Approach:
I have created the hybrid framework (POM+ TestNG +Utilities + Libraries + Data driven+ Extent reports) Which following the page chaining approach along with base test class defined separately. I have kept the playwright factory class for all the browser initializationsâ€™ and kept base test for before method and after method execution on the testcases. I have ingested the extent report listeners class which gives more concrete execution reports which I like it most. 

#Estimation Time for completion : 1.5 Days

#Chanllenges faced:
1. More dynamic and frames in the complex webpage which is deficult for write unique locator for it.
2. More often received the webpage Err_ cache miss issue which is inconsistently happening to  handle in script level.

# Estimation time for the project : 12 Hours

#Pending items: As mentioned in the assignment task is completed however Page chaining model should be extended across all the pages in web site.
